Lab 14.1 Rolling
Assignment
Write a program that counts how many times three six-sided dice must be rolled until the values showing are all different.

DeMorgan’s laws will be useful here. You will need to extend the application of DeMorgan’s laws beyond a double exit scenario.

Here is an example of two output runs.

2 6 5  
count = 1

5 3 5
