Lab 10.3 PigLatin
Assignment
Create a method named translateToPigLatin that receives a String, converts each word in the String to Pig Latin, and returns the new Pig Latinated string. Here's how to translate the English word englishWord into the Pig Latin word pigLatinWord:

If there are no vowels in englishWord, then pigLatinWord is just englishWord + "ay". (There are ten vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and their uppercase counterparts. ‘y’ is not considered to be a vowel for the purposes of this assignment, i.e. my becomes myay, why becomes whyay, etc.)
Else, if englishWord begins with a vowel, then pigLatinWord is just englishWord + "yay".
Otherwise (if englishWord has a vowel in it but doesn't start with a vowel), then pigLatinWord is end + start + "ay", where end and start are defined as follows:
Let start be all of englishWord up to (but not including) its first vowel.
Let end be all of englishWord from its first vowel on.
But, if englishWord is capitalized, then capitalize end and "uncapitalize" start.

Before you turn in your program...

Does your program re-capitalize words properly? (Basic version)
Does your program handle simple punctuation? (Advanced version)

Simple punctuation is defined as any sequence of punctuation marks that appear at the end of a word.
Example: "Hello!!! How are you, Bill?"
Try these Basic test cases:

Hasta la vista baby ➜ Astahay alay istavay abybay
Hey you Do you know how to speak in Pig Latin ➜ Eyhay ouyay Oday ouyay owknay owhay otay eakspay inyay Igpay Atinlay
Try these Advanced test cases:

Hasta la vista, baby! ➜ Astahay alay istavay, abybay!
Hey you! Do you know how to speak in Pig Latin? ➜ Eyhay ouyay! Oday ouyay owknay owhay otay eakspay inyay Igpay Atinlay?
You are encouraged to complete the Advanced version of this lab, but the Basic version is sufficient for full credit.
